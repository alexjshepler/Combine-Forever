# Combine Forever

Combine Forever is a clone of the popular game [Infinite Craft](https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/) made by Neal over at Neal.fun (You should go check him out). Now, I must admit, I haven't played too much of Infinite Craft but I've seen a bunch of YouTubers play it and it is a very unique and interesting game, but there was one flaw that I've noticed when watching other people play it. And that is not everything can be combined together. Now I'm too sure why this is, but if I had to take a stab at the reason behind this I'd say its the model that was being used. When Neil created Infinite craft he used Llama 2 to generate the new elements. This is done by feeding the model 2 different elements, and the model would try to find some sort of connection between the two elements by either logical or creative means, and if it found some connection it'd output the connecting element, but if it wasn't able to find a connection it wouldn't combine the elements. In my implementation I'm going to be doing the same thing, but the difference is I'm going to be using Llama 4 Maverick and Llama 3.1. I'm going to primarily be using Llama 4 Maverick but use Llama 3.1 with 70b tokens as a back up if I run out of tokens for Llama 4 because that is cloud hosted and llama 3.1 is locally hosted. I belive that these models will allow for more combinations because when a model has more parameters it is typically more creative.
